  AuraChain is a blockchain-powered student recognition platform that transforms classroom achievements into permanent digital
  badges. Teachers award students NFT "auras" for academic excellence, positive behavior, and milestones—creating a verifiable,
  lifelong record of accomplishments on the Solana blockchain. Students collect their auras in personalized dashboards, parents
  track their children's progress, and schools build transparent merit systems. Built with Next.js, Firebase, and Solana's Metaplex
   standard, AuraChain brings Web3 innovation to education, making recognition meaningful, tradeable, and forever.
